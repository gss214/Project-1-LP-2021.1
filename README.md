## Description

The purpose of this work is to support the management of care to be provided to a patient. The patient has a medical prescription, which indicates the medications to be taken at their respective times during a day. This prescription is organized in a medication plan that establishes, by time, which are the medications to be taken. Each medication has a name and a quantity of pills that must be administered. A caregiver on duty is responsible for providing care to the patient, whether administering medication or buying medication. Eventually, the caregiver will need to purchase medication to comply with the plan. The problem data model (type definitions) is available in the DataModel.hs file.
